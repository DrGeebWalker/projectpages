                I decided to go into computer science after I was placed into a web design class freshman year
                of high school, and I loved it. I later would join the girls who code club and take AP Computer Science.
                I got my undergraduate degree from DePaul University, where I took my first artficial intelligence in my second year of study.
                I also fell in love with LISP, a langauge that not a lot of people know but I adore.
