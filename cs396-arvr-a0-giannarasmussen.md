1. Purple: Gay Feminist (pic 1)
2. Green: Enviornmentalist (pic 1)
3. Calming Header, same idea as a sunset/sunrise but using my colors. Meant to be like calming waves. (pic 2 and 3)
 
### Describe the visual style of your page
 
Soft whimsy and fantasy, a color scheme of pastels and a header with opaque pictures and drawings of myself or my fursona against a gradient. 

You look at it and go: this looks like a blog someone would have posted fanfiction on in the early-mid 2000s. 

Clearly very creative, you might think it is an artist's page instead of a Master's in AI student. 

Simplistic but not minimialist. Just a bit more than minimalist.
